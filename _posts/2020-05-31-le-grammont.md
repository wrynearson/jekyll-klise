A few weeks after seeing some incredible photos from [this post](https://www.novo-monde.com/en/hike-switzerland-grammont/), Le Grammont was immediately placed in the top spot of my bucket list of hikes to do in Switzerland. Being relatively close to Geneva, this short but steep hike seemed to have it all on paper - a trailhead accessible by public transportation (usually, not during these Covid-19 times though), a lake to stop at a third of the way up, stunning views, breathtaking views, amazing views...let's just say the views were the main calling card.

# Getting There

Switzerland has great public transportation, but being the cheap and crazy master's students that we are, we decided to get there by less-conventional methods - a mixture of biking, driving (for the friends, public transportation for me), and of course, hiking.

With far too much coffee and caffine coursing through our veins, we set off from Geneva by bike to Lausanne, roughly 60 km away.

We met our friends in Lausanne. A nice, hearty portion rice salad in the garden fueled the five of us for the next leg of the trip - sitting on the train and bus (for me), and driving (for them) to the trailhead in Miex, Le Flon, where our hike would begin.

# The Hike

### Le Flon to Taney Lake

A quick 35 minutes of moving timeand 350m up through a nice wooded trail brough us to the beautiful alpine Taney Lake. This is a very accessable (and very popular) day hike, and for good reason. The short hike up leads hikers to a clear, deep blue lake surrounded by towering peaks and alpine vegetation, with cute and rustic Swiss lodges offering food, drink and a few beds to spend the night. We didn't let these comforts distract us, so we kept on climbing.

### Taney Lake to Le Grammont

The hike up to Le Grammont is relatively straightforward, involving 700m of gradual to moderately-steep elevation gain, which took us about 1 hour and 20 minutes to complete. While relatively straightforward, the hike was incredibly beautiful.
