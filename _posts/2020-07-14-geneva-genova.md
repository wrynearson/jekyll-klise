## Day 1:  Geneva - Col de Tamiè

- Started in the early afternoon, due to packing and logistics with friends and family.
  - Francesco's last day in Geneva!
- Went to Annecy first, we were excited but the road and traffic condition wasn't great.
- We arrived at 17:30, and took advantage of our first accomplishment with a tour of the beautiful city and a large dinner filled with beer and cheese.
- Post-dinner ride along the gorgeous lake and cycling path with dramatic skies and full stomachs.
- Planned on arriving before dark, but made it to the lesser-known Col de Tamiè `907m` at 22:30 and set up camp due to photo stops and bathroom emergencies.
  - We assumed it was in the middle of nowhere, but was next to a touristic restaurant and livestock.

## Day 2: Col de Tamiè - Col du Télégraphie

- Francesco, Johan and Will enjoyed mellow descents and chirping birds in the forest.
- A sketchy and dirty bar for breakfast (with coffee).
- We were contemplating master's thesis decisions, and Fra joined in on a Zoom call with his Matrix Bluetooth glasses.
- Blasted Led Zeppelin to get up to a nice picnic spot.
- Had a "biker's special" lunch in La Chambre
- Dropped off Johan at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne
- Before our final planned ascension to Col du Télégraphie, Fra realized he needed to pee (a frequent realization on bike trips)
  - He went into a modern bakery *Le Frui'Thé*.
  - Once seeing the nice selection, we decided to quickly fuel up fuel :fuelpump:
  - After talking briefly about our trip, the owner offered us a few extras - a few pastries and raspberry tarts.
  - Upon seeing our starved gaze, she continued to empty her shop to fill our box of free goodies. We were beyond elated.
- Our fuel up proved helpful - we reached the top of the call around 21:00, with plenty of light left.
- Upon realizing our targeted sleeping spot (a what we assumed to be an abandoned castle) was in fact an active military base, we descended into Valloire and reluctantly paid 10 euros for a flat piece of grass and warm showers. We needed this for our following three days of insanity.

## Day 3: Col du Télégraphie - Col Du Galibier - Col d'Izoard

- An unexplainably slow start to the day (finishing the pastries, shower, pack, 2nd breakfast in Valloire) meant the most famous climb was done in the heat of the day.
- Our start at roughly 12:00 lead to us dripping with sweat, and filling our brains with doubt, almost instantly.
- This discomfort quickly turned into awe as we gazed upon some of the most stunning mountain landscapes we had ever seen. Despite the heat, the perfect weather also put us in good spirits.
- A steady pace, infrequent photo breaks, and friendly competition brought us to the top of Col Du Galibier ```2642m```. We enjoyed ourselves on the top, and were overwhelmed by the beauty of the place. 
- We decided to rest and wait for the mid-afternoon heat to pass, so we found a park in Briançon and relaxed for a few hours. 
  - We made ourselves so comfortable that one man felt obliged to tell us that camping wasn't allowed in this city park.
- At around 19:00 (with plenty of light), we commenced our second intense climb of the day - Galibier wasn't enough!
- Despite some increasingly severe neck pain for me (Will), the beautiful evening light and serene mountain conditions put us in a meditative state.
- The sunset at roughly 21:30 knocked us out of this meditation and gave us motivation to continue the gorgeous ascent on perfect tarmac.
  - Lugers were taking advantage of the good conditions and near-zero car traffic, so much so that they almost collided with us!
- A dusk photo under the summit monument gave us an earned sense of accomplishment.
- We hiked up another 20m to a flat patch of land and slept soudly
